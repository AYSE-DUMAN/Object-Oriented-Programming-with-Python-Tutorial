# Object-Oriented Programming with Python
 
This repository provides examples and explanations of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It includes practical code snippets to demonstrate key principles of OOP, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, as well as Python-specific features like generators and iterators.

## Contents

- **Inheritance**: Demonstrates how a class can inherit methods and properties from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: Shows how objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling method overriding and dynamic method calls.
- **Encapsulation**: Explains the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class, and controlling access to the class variables.
- **Generators**: Examples showcasing Python's generator functions and the `yield` keyword to create iterators for efficient data processing.
- **Iterators**: Provides examples of creating and using custom iterator classes in Python.

## Features

- Code examples for each OOP principle.
- Clear comments and explanations for better understanding.
- Pythonic approaches for each concept.
- Helps in mastering Python's OOP capabilities for cleaner and more maintainable code.
